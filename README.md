## Project Overview

This is one of the projects of Udacity Deep Learning Degree.
The Goal was to create a GAN Network capable of generating 32x32 px images of "fake celebirities" basing on Celeba Dataset.
I have modified it to generate 64x64 px to correspond more to the orginal paper.
Please refer to the Description in the notebook for more details.
